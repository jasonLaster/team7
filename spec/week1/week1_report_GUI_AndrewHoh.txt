Currently, the status of the GUI is extremely behind from the norm. The essentials of the GUI are somewhat incorporated, but there are still a few features missing from the GUI. The menus and the spin buttons were something that I didn't take into account before creating the technical and functional specifications. The initial screen was implemented well, but the menus still had a few glitches.
