#Core Specifications

##Overview
	The core is the underlying base that interfaces the hardware capabilities with the user.
This spec is not yet complete, it is intended to be used to help the coder to write the core source files.

##Functional Specifications
	The user will interact with the core through the Psyche GUI. The code is predominantly from the core of the piano project.
The core allows the user to play notes either by using the keyboard or by 
loading a song from a file with the lilypond (*.ly) file format.

##Technical Specifications
	The core structure consists of 5 members: Mapii keyboard_map, FluidSynth synth, Instrument player, Instrument song, and int current_subdiv.
The keyboard_map member contains the mapping from keyboard keys to midi notes. It has the associated functions: core_note_to_midi, core_keyboard_to_midi,
core_midi_to_keyboard, core_load_keyboard_map.  Nothing too fancy going on here, just a simple mapii data structure that holds the keyboard ascii values as keys
and midi note values as values.
	The synth member is a FluidSynth object that interfaces with the audio hardware. The Instrument struct stores the midi instrument,
the midi instrument, an array of notes (if the song is from a file), and a number of notes (if the song is from a file).  It has 
two separate new functions, one for a 'player' and one for loading a song from a file. It also has functions for playing a note
and stopping a note. Again, nothing tricky going on here.
	The trickiest core function comes in Load.c.  This function is used to parse the lilypond file and store the notes in an
Instrument struct's array.
