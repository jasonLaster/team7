The Load File has the important task of comprehending the notes on the text file and then appending it to a comprehensive array. The first function is the load file function, which takes in the name of the file and creates a FILE struct from it. Then the FILE is sent to the parse_song function, which begins dissecting the file. The function uses the fgetc() function and checks if the character is a space of a return. While, the character is not a space or return, the character is appended to an array. When the character is a space or return, the array is passed to note_comprehension and then the NOTE is sent to update_song which adds the new note to the array. Finally, the string and the counter is reset. The note_comprehension function takes in a string, which is the representation of the note, and determines the MIDI value and the duration. Within the note_comprehension, there is a closest_note function that determines which octave the current note is in determined by the relative note. These values are then placed within a NOTE struct, which holds the MIDI value, the initial note on time, and the note off time. This new NOTE object is then transferred to the update_song, which takes in the NOTE and array. The update_song effectively adds the NOTE values into the song array.
