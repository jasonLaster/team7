#Server Specifications
These specifications are a simple starting point for the more rich server protocol which we will determine later.

##Functional Specifications
From the user's standpoint the server will be pretty much invisible. It will be the outlet through which the user can chat with all users,
and play notes to all the users.

##Technical Specifications
For now the server will be set up to listen for connections on port 7744 (or TBD). It will use select() to do multiplexing. It will 
store the open channels in a set structure that keeps track of which channels are open.  The server will tell the client which channel
it is on when it connects using the command `CONNECT N`, where N is the channel number.
Any message the server receives from a client will be relayed to all the clients who are also connected to the server.
